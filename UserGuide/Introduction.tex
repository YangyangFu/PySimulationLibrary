\section{Introduction}
This user guide is aimed to aid the user in setting up the Python Simulation Library (in the following abbreviated with PySimLib), run it, and explain the libraries features.
After reading this document the user should be able to simulate models using the PySimLib and be able to use it in Python in order to create own simulation descriptions.
